# Work Order System
This is being created using django. Most likely I will be using geodjango to allow the addition of maps, but I'm going to check the ESRI API to see how integrations can be done as they are simple react components.

I've noticed many problems with work orders marketed to cities. I also understand what a city wants with their work order systems after working for one in their GIS dept. This is more of a baseline blueprint that will be improved with time.
